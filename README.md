In my work, large-scale file renaming from different clients is necessary.

This could be a simple task if all our stakeholders maintained the same format for the nomenclature of the files, 
however, this is not the case, and being constantly changing staff makes it difficult to instruct them.

This is why this script is created, to be able to add a prefix to all the files within a folder, thus respecting the original name of the file but adding 
a prefix with the established nomeclature.

This saves time on this repetitive task, making the process more efficient.

It is only necessary to run the .bat file in the folder where you want to add a prefix to the file names and follow the instructions, 
this works with all files except the .bat type files that were excluded so as not to affect the original file.
